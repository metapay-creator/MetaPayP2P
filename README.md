MetaPayP2P – Web3 Basic Income Simulation with Peer Transfers

  

🧭 "Freedom through basic income — made sustainable via smart contracts and AI."
>>>>>>> d31685028e61c0b83ec0b6dff87df16b4e1a19fb

A circulating basic income simulation with blockchain distribution, AI behavior monitoring, and real-time peer transfers.

🌍 Why This Matters

<<<<<<< HEAD
**MetaPayP2P** demonstrates a sustainable, self-circulating basic income model —  
one that doesn’t rely on unlimited government funding or taxation.  
By combining immutable blockchain distribution with non-intrusive AI monitoring,  
MetaPay enables digital economic freedom and scalable public benefit.

🧪 Simulation Structure

Total: 15 rounds

10 rounds of national wallet distribution

<<<<<<< HEAD
⏱️ **Time-Compressed Simulation**

- 2 minutes simulate 1 month.
- Every 2 minutes, the national wallet distributes 500 units to 10 users.
- After each distribution, P2P transfers are allowed for 1 minute, starting 30 seconds after funds are received.
- Data is then collected, and the next round begins.
- After 10 distributions, 5 rounds of collection + redistribution follow.
=======
5 rounds of collection + redistribution

Full cycle ≈ 30 minutes (accelerated for testing)

⏱️ Time-Compressed Simulation

2 minutes simulate 1 month.

📱 Test DApp Details

A separate frontend DApp is provided for each of the 10 test users.

<<<<<<< HEAD
## 🤖 AI Analyze (Experimental)

This simulation includes an experimental AI module that analyzes P2P transactions.

### 🔧 How to Use AI

```bash
cd ai-server
node server.js
```

### 📊 Example Output

- User1 frequently sends to User3 – possible payroll pattern.  
- User5 is inactive over 5 rounds – dormant wallet.  
- User7 only receives and never sends – potential accumulation.

⚠️ *Disclaimer:* This AI analysis module is experimental.  
Results may vary based on input data and user behavior patterns.  
No financial or behavioral decisions should rely solely on this module.
=======
You will receive a Sepolia wallet address and DApp link to participate.

MetaMask must be connected to the Sepolia testnet.
>>>>>>> d31685028e61c0b83ec0b6dff87df16b4e1a19fb

You must initiate at least one P2P transfer within the allowed time per round.

📌 Requirements

Sepolia testnet ETH is required to cover gas fees.

Only developers or active Web3 users may apply. Not open to general users.

🔒 AI never interferes with the national wallet’s fund flow.  
It supports user behavior transparency — not control.

- 🧠 Role of AI in MetaPay

MetaPay ensures immutable monthly distribution and automatic collection to guarantee fairness and sustainability.The AI module only analyzes peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, offering risk alerts and optimization suggestions.

✅ AI Capabilities:

Detects abnormal behaviors (e.g., always sending or never sending)

Flags dormant wallets

Suggests optimized transfer logic (e.g., corporate salaries, vendor payments)

Never controls or interrupts the base circulation logic

🔒 AI never interferes with the national wallet’s fund flow.It supports user behavior transparency—not control.

This structure ensures AI is used ethically and effectively, supporting financial autonomy.
